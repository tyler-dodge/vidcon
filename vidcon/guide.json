But it doesn't have to be. In this session you will find a unique case study about the Identity Monitor brand that reveals how a potentially tumultuous relationship between a video media buyer and an audience development company can actually be smooth sailing. You'll gain lessons from two organizations on successfully partnering to achieve a common purpose: Driving loads of (top quality) traffic to a Youtube campaign with an earned media guarantee. In short, it's a how-to on making a client video \"go viral\". This case study, presented by Alphabird CEO Chase Norlin, joined by SmithGifford Social Media Director Fred Krazeise, illustrates how a harmonious digital ecosystem of audiences, media buyers and publishers is not fantasy, but a circle of life.<br /><br /><br /><b>Redefining Celebrity in the Post-TV Era</b><small>Robert Weiss, Chief Operating Officer, EQAL</small><br /><br />   The buzz word \"influencers\" has taken on new meaning online, especially socially. An influencer can mention your name or brand and it appears in millions of Twitter and Facebook feeds, on Pinterest, StumbleUpon and the rest and your video gets shared with everyone who follows the cool kid! It's what we strive for to build numbers. Influencers are television, music and movie celebrities as well as YouTube breakouts who have followings of hundreds of millions who follow their leads because they trust the content provider. YouTube Original Channels are being built around such influencers and are doubling down on the home grown YouTube stars like Elle & Blair Fowler, the fashion & beauty sensations with more than 350 million video views between them. At the same time, the expanded use of personal electronics by every demographic and the easy access to apps has put the celebrity voice directly into the hands of every fan who wants to be close.

Companies that have traditionally made money selling video subscriptions have been wary of online video and the competition that it brings. Unfortunately, many of these same companies also control the pipes that deliver the internet to our homes. This talk will discuss how control of the pipe can be used against online video, and what is being done in Washington, DC to protect a truly competitive online video environment.<br /><br /><br /><b>Two Way Television is Here</b><small>Adi Sideman, CEO YouNow</small><br />   Adi Sideman, the CEO of YouNow delivers an entertaining and provocative look at what our TV experience will look like a short 2 years from now. A technologist and a social game designer, Mr. Sideman will show the evolution of Television into a \"many-to-many\" participatory medium. Hear and see what lies beyond the second screen approach, what tomorrow's reality shows will look like and why Foursquare checkins will include live broadcasting.
